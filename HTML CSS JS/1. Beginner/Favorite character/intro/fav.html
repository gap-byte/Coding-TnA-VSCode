        About FQ20
      </h1>
      <p>
        Prior to his Grand Prix career, Quartararo won six Spanish junior championship titles, including successive CEV Moto3 titles in 2013 and 2014. Due to his successes at a young age, he has been tipped for "big things",[3] even being compared to multiple time world champion Marc Márquez,[4][5] and set various age records during his progress up to World Championship level. He failed to meet the high expectations in the Moto3 and Moto2 World Championships, but made the move up to MotoGP with Petronas Yamaha SRT, and finished as rookie of the year in 2019 with seven podiums and 5th place in the overall standings. After collecting 3 victories in the compressed 2020 season, Quartararo moved up to the Yamaha Factory Racing Team for 2021 replacing Valentino Rossi, and won the championship in his first season collecting 5 victories and 10 podiums.<br><br>
        Of Italian origin, as he was born into a Sicilian family moved to France, he can be considered a son of art: his father, Étienne, competed in the 1986 French motorcycle Grand Prix in the 250 class. On 14 July 2022 he was awarded a knight of the Legion of Honour.<br><br>
        Early career. Born in Nice, Quartararo started his career in his native France at the age of 4. He later moved to Spain to compete in the Promovelocidad Cup, a series for young riders organised by the Real Automóvil Club de Cataluña (RACC).[6] He won championship titles in the series' 50cc class in 2008, the 70cc class in 2009, and the 80cc class in 2011. Prior to moving into the senior Moto3 series in Spain, Quartararo won the Mediterranean pre-Moto3 class in 2012, which was also denoted as the Spanish domestic championship.<br><br>
        In August 2018, it was announced that Quartararo would join Franco Morbidelli at the newly created Yamaha satellite team, Petronas Yamaha SRT, in 2019.[29] He would be intended to riding with a 2018-spec Yamaha. However, Yamaha gave him a factory-spec Yamaha - known as the "Spec-B".<strong>
          “El Diablo.”</strong>
        <br><br> He qualified on pole position for the Spanish Grand Prix. With this pole position he took the record for youngest ever polesitter in the MotoGP class, a record previously held by Marc Márquez since 2013. He also qualified on pole position in Catalunya (ultimately finishing the race in second place) and the following race in Assen, setting a new lap record and becoming the youngest rider with consecutive pole positions in MotoGP history.[30] He finished third in Assen, behind Maverick Viñales and Marc Márquez. The next race at the Sachsenring, he qualified second, behind Marc Márquez. During the second lap of the race Quartararo slumped in the third corner while sitting on the inside with Danilo Petrucci. He ended up in the gravel. This crash was the first crash during a race in his rookie season in MotoGP.[31] Quartararo achieved further podium finishes on the season with a third place in Austria and four second-place finishes in San Marino, Thailand, Japan, and Valencia. He started from pole position in Thailand, Malaysia, and Valencia. Quartararo ultimately finished the season in 5th place of the riders' standings with 192 points, 7 podiums, and 6 pole positions.
        <br><br> At the first race of the delayed 2020 season in Jerez, Quartararo qualified on pole position and went on to take his maiden victory in the premier class after briefly dropping as low as 5th place on the opening lap.[32] At the second round of the Jerez double-header Quartararo repeated the statistic by qualifying on pole and winning the race, this time leading from the outset and building a lead of over 8 seconds by the 20th lap before cruising to the finish by 4.5 seconds over Maverick Viñales.[33][34] After difficulties in the subsequent five races, Quartararo saw his early championship advantage erode by the mid-point of the season. He achieved his third win at the Catalunya round to retake the championship lead.[35] At the first Aragon round he suffered an injured hip after an FP3 highside crash but was cleared by medical staff to take part in qualifying, where he went on to take pole position.[36] Lingering pain and struggles with the front tire in the track conditions caused him to drop quickly down the back, ultimately finishing in 18th place,[37] his first non-retirement finish outside of the points in MotoGP since his first-ever race in Qatar.
        <br><br> After a rookie season in MotoGP, Yamaha Factory Racing announced on 29 January 2020 that Quartararo would replace Valentino Rossi beginning with the 2021 season and that he would receive factory-supported machinery for his remaining season at Petronas Yamaha SRT.
        <br><br> At the start of the season, he struggled a lot with his bike, with a 9th-place finish at the opening round. He set the pole position time in Mandalika with 0.2 seconds ahead of Jorge Martín. That was the only pole position for the Frenchman in 2022. He won 3 races before the summer break, including Portugal, Catalan, and German Grands Prix. By the end of the season, he finished with 248 points, 8 podiums, and three DNFs. Quartararo finished in second place in the final standings behind Francesco Bagnaia, after a championship battle which saw the latter overcome a 91-point lead held by Quartararo after the German Grand Prix.
        <br><br> On 2 June 2022, Quartararo signed a contract extension with the team for 2023 and 2024.[46] He took his first podium of the season at the 2023 Motorcycle Grand Prix of the Americas. He took two more podiums for the rest of the season in India and Indonesia. He ended the season ahead of teammate Morbidelli, and 10th in the rider standings.
        <br><br> On 5 April 2024, Quartararo signed a contract extension with the team for 2025 and 2026.
